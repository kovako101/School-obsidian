#### Billy questions
- I would not because there was no electronics to play with and there was a lot of criminals and killings
- no i do not believe in revenge
- i mean he did kill a lot of people and he had proved that jail was not enough and considering the time this took place i think it was fair
- i do not think that he would be unbiased because he was against him for a long time
