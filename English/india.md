Her farther was talking to the farther of a boy. Which decided to marry her and she was very happy about it. But alot of people were mad about it because they wanted to marry her. But they began to arrange the marriage. When the marriage started everyone was very happy. Until a man come to the door and told the mother that something bad was going to happen. The mother did not belive him and moved on. It was getting late and the family said that the first time they would "do it" there needed to be a white towel under for "traditional" reasons. She did and then the next day everyone was mad at her. Because there was no blood on the towel and "only cheaters" did not have blood on the towel.
