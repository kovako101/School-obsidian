### bullshit diary
- day. 1: 
Today i went onto the big "*titanic*" it was very magnificent and very large. There was a lot of people boarding the ship. When we entered our first class room we sat down and unpacked our things. I met a man called Gary who showed us around the ship and were we would live for the next week. It was gigantic i am quite exited for New York. Then i went to sleep in my bed.

- day. 4:
There was a leakage at the ship and the ship is currently sinking. Only women and children are allowed on the life boats but i will make sure that i get on one. I am after all on first class... There is less and less lifeboats i am unsure if i am going to survive but i will probably find a way... I bribed one of the staff of the ship and got a spot on one of the boats. I might survive now after all but there is still at problem and that is the other people on the lifeboats. I feel like they do not like me. Just because i bribed one of the staff. I find that to be quite unfair. I just used some of my assets to survive i do not see what is wrong with that at all. But anyway i see the rescue ship coming so  i do not have to worry about that anymore. I am going home!
